# Documentation

Two different implementations exist on this repo currently:

GraphHighCharts.js and useChartData.js files are for HighCharts.

Graph.js and useCrateGraph.js files are for TradingView Lightweight.

TradingView related components will be converted into comments soon, if the HighCharts is decided as main graph library.

# Currently Implemented Features

- Dynamically adding indicators such as volume / rsi.
- Light and Dark Modes

# How to run?

1- npm install (only on first run)

2- npm run start

Initially HighCharts version will be rendered, to see TradingView version convert the comment on App.js to render Graph component.
